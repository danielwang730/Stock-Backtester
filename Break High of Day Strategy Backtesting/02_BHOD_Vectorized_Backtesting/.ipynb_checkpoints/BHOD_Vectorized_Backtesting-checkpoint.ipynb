    "# Break High of Day (BHOD) Strategy Vectorized Backtesting\n",
    "In this notebook, instead of performing event-driven backtests, we're vectorizing the process, which exponentially decreases the amount of time it takes for the backtests to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, we will specifically focus on the Break High of Day (BHOD) strategy, as it's relatively simple to understand and implement, and we believe it has a high success rate. Furthermore, we believe that we can use this backtesting method to fine-tune the BHOD strategy even further, as we can alter different parameters of the strategy and see how it would have performed with historical data. Once we find the optimal parameters, we ultimately hope to test this strategy in the stock market to see how well it can do."

In this vectorized backtesting format, instead of sequentially running through all the data, we can utilize the pandas to vectorize that process using a different set of logic.

For a simplified summary, the strategy involves checking when the price of a stock breaks its previous high of the day, and after confirming a series of conditions, enters a long trade. To exit a trade, one of three conditions must be met: 1) at least the high of a 1-minute candlestick (CS) reaches a desired take-profit (TP) level, 2) at least the low of a 1-minute CS reaches the stop loss (SL) or breakeven point (BE), or 3) we reach 3:55pm with neither previous condition being met. In all cases above, we only trade during the regular trading hours, and we never hold overnight positions.\n",

    "While the TSLA backtest took a bit longer, it's likely due to the additional number of trades taken for TSLA. Nevertheless, we see that for a baseline volume threshold of 10%, our metrics row is exactly the same as the previous metrics table we got for the event-driven backtest, confirming our process went smoothly. Using a charting software such as Trader Workstation or TradingView reveals similar results as well."

    "# Conclusions for Vectorized Backtesting\n",
    "While not shown here, this vectorized backtesting went through numerous iterations, with each one speeding up the backtest by a little bit. Those can be found in the archive folders in this repository. However, this current iteration is the fastest that we were able to make it, balancing efficiency with versatility. Not only can we alter most parameters in the broader BHOD strategy, but for certain features (like volume threshold), our program barely needs any extra time to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we plan to use this backtest once we can obtain enough 1-minute data, and we want to see how it performs against certain Stocks in Play (SiP) that we choose every day. Moreover, using this backtesting method, we can truly analyze how well the Break High of Day Strategy does in general, and we can see how different data affects it. For example, it might work better for certain sectors of stocks than others, or it might work better for higher float stocks compared to lower float ones. Either way, we can run this backtest to see how well different stocks might perform, and we can get an unbiased idea of how to optimize this strategy afterward."
